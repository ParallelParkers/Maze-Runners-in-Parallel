# COMP137_maze
# Description: A parallelization project intended to implement a scalable parallel solution to maze generation,
#     then running various solution algorithms in parallel to solve the same maze. Timing data will then be collected and
#     displayed to demonstrate the efficiency of each algorithm with the given problem size
